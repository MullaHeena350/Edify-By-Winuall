## Description

The project consists of multiple programming tasks and challenges, each focusing on a specific aspect of software development. From implementing algorithms to building web applications and APIs, the tasks cover a wide range of topics to enhance skills and knowledge in programming and software engineering.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Implement a function to check if a given string is a palindrome

In this task, you will write a function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

### Task 2: Create a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Features
Task Management: Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, and delete tasks that are no longer needed.
Dynamic Updates: The application updates in real-time as users interact with it, providing instant feedback on task status changes.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored locally or on a server, ensuring that users can access their task lists across sessions and devices.
Customization: Users can customize task details such as priority, due date, and category to organize their tasks effectively.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to work seamlessly on different devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience.
### Technologies Used
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies for building the user interface and implementing dynamic interactions.
React/Vue (or other frontend frameworks): JavaScript frameworks for building interactive and reactive user interfaces.
LocalStorage/Database: Storage mechanisms for persisting task data locally or on a server.
RESTful API (optional): If using a server-side storage solution, a RESTful API may be used for CRUD operations on task data.

### Task 3: Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns a new array with only the unique values

You will write a function to remove duplicate integers from an array and return a new array containing only the unique values.

### Task 4: Implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number

In this task, you will implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number. Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

### Task 5: Create a dynamic form validation library in JavaScript

### Features
Input Validation: Validates form input fields based on predefined rules such as required fields, email format, minimum/maximum length, etc.
Real-time Feedback: Provides real-time feedback to users by indicating validation errors or success messages as they interact with the form.
Customization: Allows customization of validation rules and error messages to suit specific form requirements and user experience preferences.
Support for Multiple Input Types: Supports validation for a wide range of input types, including text, email, password, number, checkbox, radio buttons, etc.
Dynamic Validation Rules: Enables dynamic modification of validation rules based on user actions, form state changes, or external factors.
### Technologies Used
JavaScript: Programming language for implementing dynamic form validation logic.
HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for creating form elements and defining visual feedback for validation errors.
DOM Manipulation: Utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with form elements and update their state based on validation results.
Event Handling: Implements event listeners to capture user input events and trigger validation checks accordingly.
### Usage
Integration: Include the dynamic form validation library in your project by importing or including its JavaScript file.
Configuration: Configure validation rules and error messages for each form input field using the library's API or configuration options.
Validation: Trigger validation checks on form submission, input change events, or other relevant user interactions.
Feedback: Provide visual feedback to users by displaying error messages or indicators near invalid input fields and success messages for valid input.
Error Handling: Handle validation errors gracefully, allowing users to correct their input and resubmit the form if necessary.

### Task 6: Build a small React or Vue application that fetches data from an API

### Features
Fetch Data: Retrieves book details from a RESTful API endpoint using the fetch API or Axios library.
Display Data: Renders the fetched book information in a user-friendly format on the web page.
Responsive Design: Utilizes CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing UI elements.
### Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for structuring and presenting web content.
RESTful API: Backend service providing book data through HTTP requests.
fetch API/Axios: JavaScript APIs for making HTTP requests to fetch data from the backend.
### Usage
Run the Application: Start the React application using npm start or another command specified in the project's setup.
View Book Data: Open the web browser and navigate to the specified URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000) to see the book data displayed.
Interact with UI: Users can interact with the displayed book information, such as viewing details or performing actions like adding items to a cart.
### Notes
This application assumes that the API endpoint providing book data is accessible and returns the expected data format.
Additional features, such as pagination, filtering, or sorting, can be implemented to enhance user experience and functionality.

### Task 7: Build a RESTful API using Flask or Django
Flask Bookstore API
This Flask application serves as a RESTful API for managing a collection of books. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the book data.

### Features
Get All Books: Retrieve a list of all books in the collection.
Get Book by ID: Retrieve information about a specific book by its unique identifier.
Create New Book: Add a new book to the collection.
Update Book: Update information about an existing book.
Delete Book: Remove a book from the collection.
### Technologies Used
Flask: Python web framework for building the API endpoints.
SQLAlchemy: Object-relational mapping (ORM) library for interacting with the SQLite database.
SQLite: Lightweight database used to store book data.
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Create the database tables using flask create-tables.
Run the Flask server with python app.py.
### API Endpoints
GET /books: Retrieve all books.
GET /books/<book_id>: Retrieve a specific book by its ID.
POST /books: Create a new book.
PUT /books/<book_id>: Update an existing book.
DELETE /books/<book_id>: Delete a book.
### Error Handling
404 Not Found: Returned when a requested resource does not exist.
400 Bad Request: Returned when the request is malformed or missing required parameters.
Usage
You can use this API to build applications that require basic book management functionality. Integrate it with front-end frameworks or other back-end services as needed.


### Task 8: Create a web scraping tool using BeautifulSoup or Scrapy

### Features
Scrape Book Details: Extracts information such as title, price, and stock availability for each book listed on the webpage.
Save to CSV: Writes the scraped data to a CSV file for further analysis or storage.
### Technologies Used
requests: Library for making HTTP requests to fetch webpage content.
BeautifulSoup: Python library for parsing HTML and extracting data from web pages.
CSV: Standard library for reading and writing CSV files.
### Usage
Specify the URL: Set the URL variable to the webpage you want to scrape.
Run the Script: Execute the Python script to scrape the data.
View Output: Check the generated CSV file (books.csv) to see the scraped book details.
### Notes
This script is specifically tailored to scrape book details from a particular webpage structure. It may need modifications to work with different websites or page layouts.
### Limitations
The script may not handle changes in the webpage structure or data format gracefully. Manual adjustments might be necessary if the website layout or HTML structure changes.
You can include this description in your README.md file along with the script to provide context and usage instructions for others. Adjust it as needed based on your preferences and requirements.
